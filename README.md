# sp13-sublime-snippets

## What is it
It's a package of snippets for the super-awesome [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) for SharePoint 2013 design work. It's just getting started, so I wouldn't bother too much with installing it yet.

## Installing
Okay, it requires Package Manager, so if you have that, just open the Command Palette, type "pcar" (which should select "Package Control Add Repository"), and then paste in the URL to this repo:

## That's it?
That's it. For now. When I get more in there, I'll update the docs with usage instructions. There's something cool in there, I promise.
