# sp13-sublime-snippets

## What is it
It's a package of snippets for the super-awesome [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) for SharePoint 2013 design work. It's just getting started, so I wouldn't bother too much with installing it yet.

## Installing
Okay, it requires Package Manager, so if you have that, just open the Command Palette, type "```pcar```" (which should select "Package Control Add Repository"), and then paste in the URL to this repo:

	https://github.com/speinc/sp13-sublime-snippets
	
Once the repo is added, open up that Command Palette again and type "```pcip```" to install a new package. Scroll or type "```sp13```" to advance to the sp13-sublime-snippets package. Install it.

## Usage
Be sure you're using the HTML syntax.
	
## That's it?
That's it. For now. When I get more in there, I'll update the docs with usage instructions. There's something cool in there, I promise.
